            //misses necessarily increases. Slowing down the solver in order to speed up the pose integrator is a really, really bad trade, especially when the benefit is a few ALU ops.

            //Note that you CAN technically modify the pose in IntegrateVelocity by directly accessing it through the Simulation.Bodies.ActiveSet.Poses, it just requires a little care and isn't directly exposed.

            //If the PositionLastTimestepper or SubsteppingTimestepper are in use, the pose has not yet been integrated.
            //If your pose modification depends on the order of integration, you'll want to take this into account.

            //This is also a handy spot to implement things like position dependent gravity or per-body damping.
