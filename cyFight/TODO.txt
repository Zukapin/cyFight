Character Controller Updates -
	Standing Constraints-
		Change the current angular hinge constraint to a server constraint to limit the force applied
		Monitor character orientation, if it differs too much from 'standing' can say character is fallen over and stop constraints -- this is going to effect A Lot of things

	Turning Constraints-
		Change the one-body angular motor to a two body angular motor using the character's support OR a stubbed-out kinematic body with less force

	Hammer-
		Figure out a way to apply something more like a motor constraint -- the ballsocket position is getting set every frame which isn't really the same thing
		Can maybe just remove the distance constraint and normal position constraint and make it a ballsocketmotor, linear velocity forward, but would have to counteract gravity as well probably
