Character Controller Updates -
	Standing Constraints-
		Change the current angular hinge constraint to a server constraint to limit the force applied
		Monitor character orientation, if it differs too much from 'standing' can say character is fallen over and stop constraints -- this is going to effect A Lot of things

	Turning Constraints-
		Change the one-body angular motor to a two body angular motor using the character's support OR a stubbed-out kinematic body with less force

	Hammer-
		Figure out a way to apply something more like a motor constraint -- the ballsocket position is getting set every frame which isn't really the same thing
		Can maybe just remove the distance constraint and normal position constraint and make it a ballsocketmotor, linear velocity forward, but would have to counteract gravity as well probably

NETWORK STUFF
	Jitter Buffer
		- Server running as close as possible to 60 ups, but may not always meet that
		- Client needs to have a buffer roughly equal to the network jitter -- as the server is not necessarily pure 60fps, it should be last packet time - current time in the buffer
			- have to trust the network thread for jitter timing
				- may need to edit or move away from lidgren
			- adjust current delay to goal jitter delay over time, or with a hard jump if sufficiently out of whack
	Client Interpolation
		- Server running at 60 ups, or whatever it feels like, client can be running at any fps, so we need interpolation between server states
		- Can run the actual physics simulation, but it can get a little weird with timings, as we can only update when the server/client update times match
			- Running at 61 fps is?? Updates would only match exactly once per second
		- Can do pure graphical interpolation, but linear interpolation between pos/ori does not necessarily make sense
			- Some weird side cases where client is ~60 fps but gets 'stuck' at half a frame off so none of the rendering is actually a 'real' frame
